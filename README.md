_(Note! As whole projects' documentation will be written as engineer's thesis, this view will function as TODO)_

# University's events and notes platform

## Meeting 24.10.2023

- When adding code to the documentation, try adding them as images (solving a problem with plagiarism).
- Documentation should be started writing soon.
- When describing the application, try adding project patterns.
- Remember to balance between theory and project description.
- Add diagrams, relations, etc.
- In the topic of the chapter, add first and last name of the author (again, plagiarism stuff).
- Also, paraphrase if possible when deciding to not adding the point above.
